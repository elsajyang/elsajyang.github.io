                    <h2>Hello, my name is Elsa.</h2>
                    
                    <p>I'm a recent college grad who majored in computer science as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley.
                        
                    <p>I'm actively looking for a role as a software developer or software engineer. I'm interested in working in back-end or full stack development. I code in Python, Java, C, GoLang, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                        
                    <p>I'm currently building things, like this website, and documenting the dev process. My design philosophy is design and thought from the start.</p>
                        
                    <p>I constantly think about education, energy, materials, and waste. I look forward to how we as humans plan to transform, redefine, and advance our and technology's relationship with those spaces.</p>
