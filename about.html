                    <p>I'm a recent college grad who majored in computer science as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley.</p>

                    <p>I'm actively looking for a role as a software developer or software engineer. I'm interested in working in back-end or full stack development.</p>
                    
                    <p>I constantly think about education, energy, materials, and waste. I look forward to how we as humans plan to transform, redefine, and advance our and technology's relationship with those spaces.</p>
